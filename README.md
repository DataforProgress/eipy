This is designed to be run on the Nautilius Cluster run out of UCSD.

To run, work from the `gan-pod.sh` script. Copy the `kubectl` create commands to generate the necessary pods, then copy over the repo using `kubectl cp`. Open a shell on the pod, and run `python3 pipeline.py` or `python3 sharpr_pipeline.py`, as appropriate.
